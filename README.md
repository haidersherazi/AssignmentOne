Task Details:

Problem 1: I have created a program that will calculate the volume of the Earth and sun in cubic miles. Also, I have calculated the ratio of the volume of the sun to the volume of the Earth. Iâ€™ve used the formula given in problem 1 and created functions to calculate it.

Problem 2: I have created a program that uses the continue statement instead of break and also divides the integers up to square root to print the prime numbers up to 50.

Problem 3: I have created a program that will calculate the consonants, vowels and spaces. I have used a loop and if else statements to get the respective counts.

Problem 4: In this program, I have used the same soliloquy of problem 3 and then remove the non word characters in it. After that I broke it into the array of strings and used bubble sort. Print all the sorted word strings on the console as well.
